# flip-json-flop
Turns CSV, XLX, and XLSX files into JSON format. Is meant for easy command line usage.

Because this is achieved by first turning the CSV, XLSX, and XLSM files into pandas DataFrames, you may need to install pandas first. This can be done by installing
# pip install pandas

Below are some ways of testing out the JSON conversions:
https://json-csv.com/ (for .csv)
http://www.json-xls.com/json2xls (for .xls + .xlsx). Use Plain+Hierarchy when rendering.
